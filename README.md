This project focuses on predicting the active power output of a wind turbine using various machine learning and deep learning techniques. The dataset contains time-series data of wind speed, wind direction, and turbine output power, recorded at regular intervals. After performing thorough data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA), relevant temporal features such as hour, day, and month were engineered to improve model performance. Multiple machine learning models—including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost—were trained and evaluated. In addition, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network was implemented to capture the temporal dependencies in the data and enhance prediction accuracy. The performance of each model was compared using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R² Score. This comparative study demonstrates the effectiveness of LSTM in time-series forecasting of renewable energy generation, with potential applications in smart grid planning, energy scheduling, and power system optimization.
