This project focuses on forecasting wind power generation using real-world SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) data, collected at 10-minute intervals. The dataset includes parameters such as wind speed (in m/s), wind direction (in degrees), and active power output (in kW). The analysis begins with exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand feature distributions, identify missing values, and observe temporal trends. Multiple machine learning models—including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost—are trained and evaluated based on MAE, RMSE, and R² scores. Among them, XGBoost and Decision Tree models show comparatively higher accuracy. Additionally, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network is implemented to capture temporal dependencies and demonstrate real-time sequence modeling. While its performance is slightly lower in terms of accuracy, the LSTM model highlights the potential for integration in real-time smart grid applications such as dynamic power dispatch, load forecasting, and energy scheduling. This project illustrates how combining SCADA data with modern ML/DL techniques can support intelligent decision-making in renewable energy systems.
