This project focuses on predicting the active power output of a wind turbine using a combination of machine learning and deep learning techniques. The dataset used consists of Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) data collected from a wind turbine. It includes time-series measurements such as wind speed (m/s), wind direction (°), and the actual power generated (kW), recorded at regular 10-minute intervals.
After performing comprehensive data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA), new temporal features—such as hour of the day, day of the week, and month—were engineered to enhance the model’s ability to capture patterns in power output. Several machine learning models were implemented, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost to evaluate performance on the processed data. To further improve forecasting accuracy, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network was developed, leveraging the sequential nature of the time-series data. Model performance was evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R² Score.
This comparative study shows that LSTM outperforms traditional models for time-dependent forecasting and demonstrates strong potential for application in smart grid planning, renewable power scheduling, and real-time energy management systems.
